NOTE: the PC build is heavily preferred, as we had to disable shadows and camera blurring for the Mac. If you must play on Mac, here are instructions:

Unzip the Mac zip file.
Then, in terminal, cd into the directory where you downloaded the zip (here, assuming onto the Desktop):

cd ~/Desktop
xattr -cr ChillhopValley_Mac_NoShadows.app
